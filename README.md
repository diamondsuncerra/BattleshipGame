# BattleshipGame
  This is a 2-player game made in Java, implementing the classic Battleship game. It gets the continuous input 
of the players alternating between them and establishes a winner. In the near future, a graphical interface using Swing.

  Battleship can be played after downloading the Main file and running it.

  The games starts with getting the input from the players. The current player has to type in the coordinates that
represent where they wish to place their battleships. The coordinates are coded A-J 1-10. After a player is done, they 
press enter and it's the next player's turn. Once both parties have entered their choices, the attack starts.
  The players alternately type in one coordinate following the instruction  A-J 1-10. For all possible outcomes (hit a
  ship, miss, sink a ship, sink the last ship therefore winning the game or input non-conformity) the player is prompted
accordingly.
